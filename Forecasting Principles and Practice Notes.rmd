## Ch 1 Notes

#### 1.1

The predictability of an event or a quantity depends on several factors including:

1. how well we understand the factors that contribute to it;
2. how much data is available;
3. how similar the future is to the past;
4. whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast.

#### 1.3

Quantitative forecasting can be applied when two conditions are satisfied:

1. numerical information about the past is available;
2. it is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future.
